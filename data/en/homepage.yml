  title : "ABOUT THE PROJECT"
  description : "In July 2020 OpenStreetmap Senegal will map all the public hospitals in Senegal and update the emergency health services available. This is part of a wider campaign of healthsites.io to define emergency health services throughout Africa.  "
  content : "We currently have baseline information for a limited number of Senegalese health care facilities in OpenStreetMap. We will establish building blocks for others to use and take forward. We will compare the open data from the 197 hospitals in OpenStreetMap with that of the open dataset developed by the KEMRI-Wellcome Research Programme in 2018 and currently hosted by WHO. With support from [Afrimapr](http://afrimapr.org) we will establish R building blocks to enable customised in-country analysis using open source packages. We will track progress in terms of data capturing of additional health facilities in OSM on a daily basis. For this we will use tools such as the Ohsome application developed by HeiGIT and afrihealthsites developed by afrimapr."

  title : "WHAT WAS THE STATUS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT?"
  content : "
  At the start of this project healthsites.io had collected information on 1,221 health facilities in Senegal with most of them based in Dakar.


  Most of the health facilities available in the healthsites.io database are pharmacies (48%) with doctors (24%), clinics (14%), hospitals (10%), and dentists (3%) making up the remainder of the entries.


  Only partial information is available for all facilities listed in healthsites.io. This means most entries do not list details that are critical to support humanitarian responses.
